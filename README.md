## Simple Calculator

This is my calculator, which is created to practice the different tecnologies on the web, learn more about math operations and it's part of the proyects for freeCodeCamp curriculum.

## Live link code 

Check a demo here :  https://rvjonh-calculator.netlify.app/

## Development

If you want to check the code for practice or add more features, here is a step by step guide to run a server where you can work on the code.

1. you need installed node.js
2. you will need npm or yard to control the dependencies
3. you will need git
4. You will need VS code or and text editor.

## Optional
  5. Open a terminal o command line interface on you machine, go to desktop or navigate where you want the folder or entire project
  6. Execute next command: git clone https://github.com/Rvjonh/Calculator.git 
  7. I recomend install the extension live SASS code to create a CSS file through the SASS pre-processor, this for styling.
  
9. and finally I use CRA (Create React App) a package where it's used REACT as framework to build all the functionalities, execute: npm i
10. happy coding ... :P 

## Getting Started this proyect

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). So if you are not familiar with this tecnology check below.
